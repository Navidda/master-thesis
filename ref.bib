  abstract     = {A recent survey of cybersecurity assessment methods proposed by the scientiﬁc community revealed that their practical adoption constitutes a great challenge. Further research that aimed at identifying the reasons for that situation demonstrated that several factors inﬂuence the applicability, including the documentation level of detail, the availability of supporting tools, and the continuity of support. This paper presents the European Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Centre ({EE}-{ISAC})—a cybersecurity platform for the energy sector that has been adopted by multiple organisations. The platform facilitates sharing information about cybersecurity incidents, countermeasures, and assessment results. Prospectively, it is envisaged to be integrated with the threat intelligence platform that enables real-time situational awareness. By considering both fault and attack scenarios together, threat awareness can be mapped onto operational contexts to prioritise decisions and responses. This paper analyses {EE}-{ISAC}’s approach based on the conceptual applicability framework developed during the research, to improve the applicability and usefulness of this platform for energy sector participants and to identify areas that require further development.},

In recent years, however, the rapidly-expanding demands of “data everywhere” have led to a ﬁeld comprised of interesting and productive efforts, but without a central focus or coordinated agenda. The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizations (e.g., enterprises, government agencies, libraries, “smart” homes) relying on a large number of diverse, interrelated data sources, but having no way to manage their dataspaces in a convenient, integrated, or principled fashion. This paper proposes dataspaces and their support systems as a new agenda for data management. This agenda encompasses much of the work going on in data management today, while posing additional research objectives.},

  abstract  = {International Data Spaces ({IDS}) enable the sovereign and self-determined exchange of data via a standardized connection across company boundaries. They address the many challenges in the overarching use of data in terms of interoperability, transparency, trust, security, and adaptation by a critical mass. For this purpose, the {IDS} develops a standardized architecture, which is described and continuously updated in the {IDSA} Reference Architecture Model ({RAM}) document. The core of the underlying concept is the linkage of data and usage conditions and their organizational and technical processing and enforcement. Organizational roles and responsibilities are considered on the one hand, and various technical components are defined on the other. The core of the architecture thereby, in contrast to existing solutions and approaches of completely centralized or decentralized architectures, is the paradigm of a federated structure. This enables the actual (raw) data to be exchanged exclusively between the participants without the need for a third party or a central data store. The chapter gives an overview of this approach and provides insights in terms of objectives, roles, and components that are used to enable sovereign data exchange. It enables a basic understanding of the core concept and assessing the impact of such an architecture approach.},

New business opportunities through data-driven innovation emerge from data sharing in ecosystems. In ecosystems, the interest of the individual must be brought into alignment with the interest of the ecosystem. Trust between participants, data interoperability, and data sovereignty are key requirements which can be met by data spaces. Data spaces are a distributed data integration concept which is taken up by consortia aiming at supporting ecosystem. {GAIA}-X and {IDS} specify reference architectures for distributed data infrastructures and data spaces, respectively. While the benefits of data spaces for a fair data economy are recognized by business and policy makers, a deeper understanding is required about the design and evolution of data spaces. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts, identifies design tasks and options, and, thus, provides guidance for the establishment of data spaces.},

  abstract     = {Cyber threat intelligence ({CTI}) is widely recognized as an important area in cybersecurity but it remains an area showing silos and reserved for large organizations. For an area whose strength is in open and responsive sharing, we see that the generation of feeds has a small scale, is secretive, and is nearly always from specialized businesses that have a commercial interest in not publicly sharing insights at a speed where it could be effective in raising preparedness or stopping an attack. This article has three purposes. First, we extensively review the state and challenges of open, crowd-sourced {CTI}, with a focus on the perceived barriers. Second, having identiﬁed that conﬁdentiality (in multiple forms) is a key barrier, we perform a conﬁdentiality threat analysis of existing sharing architectures and standards, including reviewing circa one million of real-world feeds between 2014 and 2022 from the popular open platform {MISP} toward quantifying the inherent risks. Our goal is to build the case that, either by redesigning sharing architectures or simply performing simple sanitization of shared information, the conﬁdentiality argument is not as strong as one may have presumed. Third, after identifying key requirements for open crowd-based sharing of {CTI}, we propose a reference (meta-) architecture.},

  abstract    = {The International Data Spaces ({IDS}) are virtual data spaces leveraging existing standards and technologies, as well as governance models, well-accepted in the data economy, to facilitate secure and standardized data exchange and data linkage in a trusted business ecosystem. It thereby provides a basis for creating smart service scenarios and facilitating innovative cross-company business processes, while at the same time guaranteeing data sovereignty for data owners. Data sovereignty is a central aspect of the {IDS}. It can be defined as a natural person’s or corporate entity’s capability of being entirely self-determined with regard to its data. The International Data Spaces initiative proposes a Reference Architecture Model for this particular capability and related aspects, including requirements for secure and trusted data exchange in business ecosystems. Focusing on the generalization of concepts, functionality, and overall processes involved in the creation of a secure “network of trusted data”, the {IDS} Reference Architecture resides at a higher abstraction level than common architecture models of concrete software solutions do. The document provides an overview supplemented by dedicated architecture specifications defining the individual components of the {IDS} (Connector, Broker, App Store, etc.) in detail. In compliance with common system architecture models and standards (e.g., {ISO} 42010, 4+1 view model), the {IDS} Reference Architecture Model uses a five-layer structure expressing various stakeholders’ concerns and viewpoints at different levels of granularity. The general structure of the {IDS} Reference Architecture Model is made up of five layers: The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Business Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}specifies and categorizes the different roles which the participants of the {IDS} can assume, and it specifies the main activities and interactions connected with each of these roles. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Functional Layer{\textless}/em{\textgreater} defines the functional requirements of the {IDS}, plus the concrete features to be derived from these. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Process Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}specifies the interactions taking place between the different components of the {IDS}; using the {BPMN} notation, it provides a dynamic view of the Reference Architecture Model. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Information{\textless}/em{\textgreater} {\textless}em{\textgreater}Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}defines a conceptual model which makes use of linked-data principles for describing both the static and the dynamic aspects of the {IDS}’s constituents. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}System Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}is concerned with the decomposition of the logical software components, considering aspects suchas integration, configuration, deployment, and extensibility of these components. In addition, the {IDS} Reference Architecture Model comprises three perspectives that need to be implemented across all five layers: {\textless}em{\textgreater}Security, Certification, and Governance.{\textless}/em{\textgreater}},
