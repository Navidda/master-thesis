  abstract = {A recent survey of cybersecurity assessment methods proposed by the scientiﬁc community revealed that their practical adoption constitutes a great challenge. Further research that aimed at identifying the reasons for that situation demonstrated that several factors inﬂuence the applicability, including the documentation level of detail, the availability of supporting tools, and the continuity of support. This paper presents the European Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (EE-ISAC)—a cybersecurity platform for the energy sector that has been adopted by multiple organisations. The platform facilitates sharing information about cybersecurity incidents, countermeasures, and assessment results. Prospectively, it is envisaged to be integrated with the threat intelligence platform that enables real-time situational awareness. By considering both fault and attack scenarios together, threat awareness can be mapped onto operational contexts to prioritise decisions and responses. This paper analyses EE-ISAC’s approach based on the conceptual applicability framework developed during the research, to improve the applicability and usefulness of this platform for energy sector participants and to identify areas that require further development.},

  abstract   = {The development of relational database management systems served to focus the data management community for decades, with spectacular results. In recent years, however, the rapidly-expanding demands of “data everywhere” have led to a ﬁeld comprised of interesting and productive efforts, but without a central focus or coordinated agenda. The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizations (e.g., enterprises, government agencies, libraries, “smart” homes) relying on a large number of diverse, interrelated data sources, but having no way to manage their dataspaces in a convenient, integrated, or principled fashion. This paper proposes dataspaces and their support systems as a new agenda for data management. This agenda encompasses much of the work going on in data management today, while posing additional research objectives.},

  abstract = {The world of Big Data offers new ways to generate value to companies, but also confronts companies and customers with challenges in retaining control over their data. My goal in this study is to showcase what Data Sovereignty means in regard to these problems, what issues and opportunities it entails. To achieve this, the general notion of Data Sovereignty is showcased and broken down into examples, possible opportunities and conflicts found by various research are also presented. Five solutions, each of them aiming to achieve Data Sovereignty in different contexts, are presented and discussed regarding their stated goals, effectiveness and existing implementations.},

  abstract  = {International Data Spaces (IDS) enable the sovereign and self-determined exchange of data via a standardized connection across company boundaries. They address the many challenges in the overarching use of data in terms of interoperability, transparency, trust, security, and adaptation by a critical mass. For this purpose, the IDS develops a standardized architecture, which is described and continuously updated in the IDSA Reference Architecture Model (RAM) document. The core of the underlying concept is the linkage of data and usage conditions and their organizational and technical processing and enforcement. Organizational roles and responsibilities are considered on the one hand, and various technical components are defined on the other. The core of the architecture thereby, in contrast to existing solutions and approaches of completely centralized or decentralized architectures, is the paradigm of a federated structure. This enables the actual (raw) data to be exchanged exclusively between the participants without the need for a third party or a central data store. The chapter gives an overview of this approach and provides insights in terms of objectives, roles, and components that are used to enable sovereign data exchange. It enables a basic understanding of the core concept and assessing the impact of such an architecture approach.},

  abstract  = {The role data plays in enterprises is changing as the digital transformation in many sectors gains speed. New business opportunities through data-driven innovation emerge from data sharing in ecosystems. In ecosystems, the interest of the individual must be brought into alignment with the interest of the ecosystem. Trust between participants, data interoperability, and data sovereignty are key requirements which can be met by data spaces. Data spaces are a distributed data integration concept which is taken up by consortia aiming at supporting ecosystem. GAIA-X and IDS specify reference architectures for distributed data infrastructures and data spaces, respectively. While the benefits of data spaces for a fair data economy are recognized by business and policy makers, a deeper understanding is required about the design and evolution of data spaces. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts, identifies design tasks and options, and, thus, provides guidance for the establishment of data spaces.},
