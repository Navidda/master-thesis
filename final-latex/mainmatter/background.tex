security terms but don't just list
% Cybersecurity, the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data, encompasses crucial terms such as confidentiality, ensuring data privacy; in- tegrity, maintaining data accuracy and trustworthiness; availability, assuring data and systems are accessible when needed; authentication, verifying user identities; authorization, granting appropriate access; firewall, filtering network traffic; malware, malicious software; phishing, deceptive attacks; and vulnera- bility, weaknesses in systems.
