	abstract = {In the age of Industry 4.0, data exchange between different organizations is an essential prerequisite to add more value to data and to develop modern business models. However, we have to solve several challenges to facilitate a secure and trustworthy data exchange between different organizations. Data sovereignty is a key success factor for data-driven business models. In the International Data Spaces (IDS), we provide solutions to realize a secure and trustworthy data exchange as well as data sovereignty. In this report, we focus on data usage control and data provenance that are conceptual and technological solutions to cope with data sovereignty challenges. We introduce a common scenario for the Industry 4.0 age, in which a supplier and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) are exchanging data to mitigate risks in the supply chain management. We describe the difference between access control and usage control, the usage control concepts and related concepts such as digital rights management or user managed access. We present the implementation of data usage control in the IDS. In doing so, we present possible integration layers and its integration with the IDS Reference Architecture Model. In addition, we also present the IDS Usage Control Object as a way to transfer usage control metadata between connectors. We explain the topic of policy specification in the IDS by presenting the information model and policy language, the IDS policy classes and the IDS policy editor, which supports data owners to expressing usage restrictions. Furthermore, we show how we handle policy transformation to machine-readable policies as well as policy handshake and negotiation in the IDS. As there are different ways to implement data usage control, we present three approaches researched and developed within Fraunhofer: The MYDATA Control Technologies, the Logicbased Usage Control and Degree. Every technology is presented in detail including its integration concepts. Finally, we compare these technologies and discuss them. We address data provenance as additional concept to data usage control to cope with transparency and accountability. We conclude the document by elaborating on the current state and presenting future work, like the role of usage control in the App Store and automated IDS contract negotiation.},

	abstract = {The development of relational database management systems served to focus the data management community for decades, with spectacular results. In recent years, however, the rapidly-expanding demands of “data everywhere” have led to a ﬁeld comprised of interesting and productive efforts, but without a central focus or coordinated agenda. The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizations (e.g., enterprises, government agencies, libraries, “smart” homes) relying on a large number of diverse, interrelated data sources, but having no way to manage their dataspaces in a convenient, integrated, or principled fashion. This paper proposes dataspaces and their support systems as a new agenda for data management. This agenda encompasses much of the work going on in data management today, while posing additional research objectives.},

	abstract = {The Internet threat landscape is fundamentally changing. A major shift away from hobby hacking toward well-organized cyber crime can be observed. These attacks are typically carried out for commercial reasons in a sophisticated and targeted manner, and speciﬁcally in a way to circumvent common security measures. Additionally, networks have grown to a scale and complexity, and have reached a degree of interconnectedness, that their protection can often only be guaranteed and ﬁnanced as shared efforts. Consequently, new paradigms are required for detecting contemporary attacks and mitigating their effects. Today, many attack detection tasks are performed within individual organizations, and there is little crossorganizational information sharing. However, information sharing is a crucial step to acquiring a thorough understanding of large-scale cyber-attack situations, and is therefore seen as one of the key concepts to protect future networks. Discovering covert cyber attacks and new malware, issuing early warnings, advice about how to secure networks, and selectively distribute threat intelligence data are just some of the many use cases. In this survey article we provide a structured overview about the dimensions of cyber security information sharing. First, we motivate the need in more detail and work out the requirements for an information sharing system. Second, we highlight legal aspects and efforts from standardization bodies such as {ISO} and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}). Third, we survey implementations in terms of both organizational and technological matters. In this regard, we study the structures of Computer Emergency Response Teams ({CERTs}) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams ({CSIRTs}), and evaluate what we could learn from them in terms of applied processes, available protocols and implemented tools. We conclude with a critical review of the state of the art and highlight important considerations when building effective security information sharing platforms for the future.},

However, despite the potential benefits, successful cyber security information sharing has been difficult to achieve. We report upon a study that sought to measure the extent to which the benefits and barriers suggested by the cyber security information sharing literature are reflected in the attitudes of practising security managers and analysts. A self-administered online survey was used. The survey consisted of: several questions about the participants' experience with cyber security information sharing; and two sets of Likert-type scale items to measure the respondents' attitudes regarding the benefits and barriers identified in the literature. Our findings aim to highlight the gap between the theory and practice of information sharing and provide input for future research into design principles for information sharing systems and ways to mitigate threat information sharing challenges.},

This paper presents the European Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (EE-ISAC)—a cybersecurity platform for the energy sector that has been adopted by multiple organisations. The platform facilitates sharing information about cybersecurity incidents, countermeasures, and assessment results. Prospectively, it is envisaged to be integrated with the threat intelligence platform that enables real-time situational awareness. By considering both fault and attack scenarios together, threat awareness can be mapped onto operational contexts to prioritise decisions and responses. This paper analyses EE-ISAC’s approach based on the conceptual applicability framework developed during the research, to improve the applicability and usefulness of this platform for energy sector participants and to identify areas that require further development.},
