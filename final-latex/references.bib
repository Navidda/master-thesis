The Relevance Cycle inputs requirements from the contextual environment into the research and introduces the research artifacts into environmental field testing. The Rigor Cycle provides grounding theories and methods along with domain experience and expertise from the foundations knowledge base into the research and adds the new knowledge generated by the research to the growing knowledge base. The central Design Cycle supports a tighter loop of research activity for the construction and evaluation of design artifacts and processes. The recognition of these three cycles in a research project clearly positions and differentiates design science from other research paradigms. The commentary concludes with a claim to the pragmatic nature of design science.},

Aligned with the {NIS}2 Directive, Directive ({EU}) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022, digital twins play a critical role in bolstering cybersecurity measures by enabling advanced simulation and real-time monitoring, key aspects emphasized in the directive for enhancing the security of networks and information systems. Concurrently, Europe’s shift towards communal data spaces amplifies the need for robust cyber defences. This paper aims to bolster cybersecurity defences in critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on the energy sector and smart grids. It proposes an innovative architecture for cybersecurity monitoring, converting a Common Information Model-compliant system into a digital twin via the {FIWARE} platform and incorporating an open-source Security Information and Event Management solution. Validated by a real-world case study, our approach demonstrates significant advancements in protecting smart grids against cyber threats.},

	abstract = {Modern business is increasingly adopting fully-digital workflows composed of complementary services (in terms of infrastructures, software, networks, data and devices) from different domains, hence giving rise to complex and heterogeneous digital chains. The substantial fragmentation in service operation and ownership between these domains impacts cybersecurity operations, by hindering a coherent and cooperative defense strategy for the entire chain. As a result, this situation gives attackers more opportunity to move laterally within the chain once they have found and compromised the weakest link. A ground-breaking evolution of legacy cybersecurity processes is necessary towards collaborative and adaptive models that fit the dynamic, agile, and heterogeneous nature of federated environments. In this paper, we elaborate on the necessary convergence between complementary workflows for response, analysis, and intelligence, by considering the peculiarity of these operations and the relevant threat scenario. Our analysis points out the main research challenges to fill the existing gap between management and protection practice for digital service chains. Moreover, we outline a reference architecture that combines such workflows. The objective is to foster researchers to broaden the scope of their work, in order to address open security issues for modern business and computing paradigms.},

	abstract = {Cyber-attacks affect every aspect of our lives. These attacks have serious consequences, not only for cyber-security, but also for safety, as the cyber and physical worlds are increasingly linked. Providing effective cyber-security requires cooperation and collaboration among all the entities involved. Increasing the amount of cyber threat information ({CTI}) available for analysis allows better prediction, prevention and mitigation of cyber-attacks. However, organizations are deterred from sharing their {CTI} over concerns that sensitive and confidential information may be revealed to others. We address this concern by providing a flexible framework that allows the confidential sharing of {CTI} for analysis between collaborators. We propose a five-level trust model for a cloud-edge based data sharing infrastructure. The data owner can choose an appropriate trust level and {CTI} data sanitization approach, ranging from plain text, through anonymization/pseudonymization to homomorphic encryption, in order to manipulate the {CTI} data prior to sharing it for analysis. Furthermore, this sanitization can be performed by either an edge device or by the cloud service provider, depending upon the level of trust the organization has in the latter. We describe our trust model, our cloud-edge infrastructure, and its deployment model, which are designed to satisfy the broadest range of requirements for confidential {CTI} data sharing. Finally we briefly describe our implementation and the testing that has been carried out so far by four pilot projects that are validating our infrastructure.},

We discuss the common problems within the domain of {CTI} sharing and we propose a new model, that leverages the security properties of blockchain. Our model provides a more effective and efficient framework for a {CTI} sharing network that has the potential to overcome the trust barriers and data privacy issues inherent in this domain.

	abstract = {Cooperative cyberdefense has been recognized as an essential strategy to ﬁght against cyberattacks. Cybersecurity Information Sharing ({CIS}), especially about threats and incidents, is a key aspect in this regard. {CIS} provides members with an improved situational awareness to prepare for and respond to future cyberthreats. Privacy preservation is critical in this context, since organizations can be reluctant to share information otherwise. This is particularly critical when {CIS} is facilitated through an untrusted infrastructure provided by a third party (e.g., the cloud). Despite this, current data formats and protocols for {CIS} do not guarantee any form of privacy preservation to participants. In this paper we introduce {PRACIS}, a scheme for {CIS} networks that guarantees private data forwarding and aggregation. {PRACIS} leverages the well-known Structured Threat Information Expression ({STIX}) standard data format. Remarkably, {PRACIS} can be seamlessly integrated with existing {STIXbased} message brokering middleware such as publish-subscribe architectures. {PRACIS} achieves these goals by combining standard format-preserving and homomorphic encryption primitives. We discuss experimental results obtained with a prototype implementation developed for a subset of {STIX}. Results show that entities may create up to 689 incidents per minute, far beyond the estimated average of 81. Moreover, aggregation of 104 incidents can be carried out in just 2.1 s, and the transmission overhead is just 13.5 kbps. Overall, these results suggest that the costs incurred by {PRACIS} are easily affordable in real-world scenarios.},

	abstract = {In recent years, cyber security attacks have increased massively. This introduces the need to defend against such attacks. Cyber security threat intelligence has recently been introduced to secure systems against security attacks. Cyber security threat intelligence ({CTI}) should be fast, trustful, and protect the sender's identity to stop these attacks at the right time. Threat intelligence sharing is vitally important since it is considered an effective way to improve threat understanding. This leads to protecting the assets and preventing the attack vectors. However, there is a paradox between the privacy safeguard needs of threat intelligence sharing; the need to produce complete proper threat intelligence feeds to be shared with the community, and other challenges and needs that are not covered in the traditional {CTI}. This paper aims to study how Blockchain technology can be incorporated with the {CTI} to solve the current issues and challenges in the traditional {CTI}. We collected the latest contributions that use Blockchain to overcome the conventional {CTI} problems and compared them to raise the reader’s awareness about the different methods used. Also, we mentioned the uncovered areas for each paper to offer a wide range of details and information about different areas that need to be investigated. Furthermore, the prospect challenges of integrating the Blockchain and {CTI} are discussed.},

Although the importance of collaborative cyber-security consciousness, expressed as extensive cyber threat intelligence sharing, is undoubted, the standardization of the means of exchanging cyber threat information efficiently and securely has been inadequately addressed and is mostly expressed by the emergence of the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXIITM) protocol which faces major deficiencies when it comes to data integrity assurance and suitability for event-driven architectures. This paper presents a novel approach enabling secure and real-time exchange of cyber threat information, by extending the technological capacity of the TAXII framework and addressing its deficiencies through the integration of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and a generalized publish-subscribe middleware. The applicability of the proposed solution has been validated in several use cases addressing the real needs of Electrical Power and Energy Systems.},

As Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), the industry needs to understand the threats it faces to mitigate risks and make efficient use of limited resources. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing is one means of achieving this, by leveraging sector-wide knowledge to combat ongoing mutual threats. However, being unable to segregate intelligence or to control what is disseminated to which parties, and by which means, has impeded industry cooperation thus far. The purpose of this study is to investigate the barriers to sharing and to add to the body of knowledge of CTI in the UK energy sector, while providing some level of assurance that existing tooling is fit-for-purpose. We achieve these aims by conducting a multivocal literature review and by experimentation using a simulated Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) community in a virtual environment. This work demonstrates that trust can be placed in the open-source MISP platform, with the caveat that the sharing models and tooling limitations are understood, while also taking care to create appropriate deployment taxonomies and sharing rules. It is hoped that some of the identified barriers are partially alleviated, helping to lay the foundations for a UK Energy sector CTI sharing community.},

For an area whose strength is in open and responsive sharing, we see that the generation of feeds has a small scale, is secretive, and is nearly always from specialized businesses that have a commercial interest in not publicly sharing insights at a speed where it could be effective in raising preparedness or stopping an attack. This article has three purposes. First, we extensively review the state and challenges of open, crowd-sourced {CTI}, with a focus on the perceived barriers. Second, having identiﬁed that conﬁdentiality (in multiple forms) is a key barrier, we perform a conﬁdentiality threat analysis of existing sharing architectures and standards, including reviewing circa one million of real-world feeds between 2014 and 2022 from the popular open platform {MISP} toward quantifying the inherent risks. Our goal is to build the case that, either by redesigning sharing architectures or simply performing simple sanitization of shared information, the conﬁdentiality argument is not as strong as one may have presumed. Third, after identifying key requirements for open crowd-based sharing of {CTI}, we propose a reference (meta-) architecture.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the Trusted Integrated Knowledge Dataspace (TIKD), a new dataspace, based on linked data technologies and trusted data sharing, that supports integrated knowledge graphs for sensitive application environments such as healthcare. State-of-the-art shared dataspaces do not consider sensitive data and privacy-aware log records as part of their solutions, deﬁning only how to access data. TIKD complements dataspace security approaches through trusted data sharing that considers personal data handling, data privileges, pseudonymization of user activity logging, and privacy-aware data interlinking services. TIKD was implemented on the Access Risk Knowledge (ARK) Platform, a socio-technical risk governance system, and deployed as part of the ARK-Virus Project which aims to govern the risk management of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) across a group of collaborating healthcare institutions. The ARK Platform was evaluated, both before and after implementing the TIKD, using the ISO 27001 Gap Analysis Tool (GAT) which determines compliance with the information security standard. The results of the evaluation indicated that compliance with ISO 27001 increased from 50\% to 85\%. The evaluation also provided a set of recommended actions to meet the remaining requirements of the ISO 27001 standard. TIKD provides a collaborative environment, based on knowledge graph integration and GDPR-compliant personal data handling, as part of the data security infrastructure. As a result of this work, a new trusted data security methodology, based on personal data handling, data privileges, access control context speciﬁcation, and privacyaware data interlinking, was developed using a knowledge graph approach.},

	abstract = {As smart environments move from a research vision to concrete manifestations in real-world enabled by the Internet of Things, they are encountering a number of very practical challenges in data management in terms of the flexibility needed to bring together contextual and real-time data, the interface between new digital infrastructures and existing information systems, and how to easily share data between stakeholders in the environment. Therefore, data management approaches for smart environments need to support flexibility, dynamicity, incremental change, while keeping costs to a minimum. A Dataspace is an emerging approach to data management that has proved fruitful for personal information and scientific data management. However, their use within smart environments and for real-time data remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as an enabling platform for data management within smart environments. This paper identifies common data management requirements for smart energy and water environments, details the RLD architecture and the key support services and their tiered support levels, and a principled approach to “Pay-As-You-Go” data management. The paper presents a dataspace query service for real-time data streams and entities to enable unified entity-centric queries across live and historical stream data. The RLD was validated in 5 real-world pilot smart environments following the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop to build real-time analytics, decisions support, and smart apps for energy and water management. The pilots demonstrate that the RLD enables incremental pay-as-you-go data management with support services that simplify the development of applications and analytics for smart environments. Finally, the paper discusses experiences, lessons learnt, and future directions.},

	abstract = {The International Data Spaces (IDS) are virtual data spaces leveraging existing standards and technologies, as well as governance models, well-accepted in the data economy, to facilitate secure and standardized data exchange and data linkage in a trusted business ecosystem. It thereby provides a basis for creating smart service scenarios and facilitating innovative cross-company business processes, while at the same time guaranteeing data sovereignty for data owners. Data sovereignty is a central aspect of the IDS. It can be defined as a natural person’s or corporate entity’s capability of being entirely self-determined with regard to its data. The International Data Spaces initiative proposes a Reference Architecture Model for this particular capability and related aspects, including requirements for secure and trusted data exchange in business ecosystems. Focusing on the generalization of concepts, functionality, and overall processes involved in the creation of a secure “network of trusted data”, the IDS Reference Architecture resides at a higher abstraction level than common architecture models of concrete software solutions do. The document provides an overview supplemented by dedicated architecture specifications defining the individual components of the IDS (Connector, Broker, App Store, etc.) in detail. In compliance with common system architecture models and standards (e.g., ISO 42010, 4+1 view model), the IDS Reference Architecture Model uses a five-layer structure expressing various stakeholders’ concerns and viewpoints at different levels of granularity. The general structure of the IDS Reference Architecture Model is made up of five layers: The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Business Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}specifies and categorizes the different roles which the participants of the IDS can assume, and it specifies the main activities and interactions connected with each of these roles. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Functional Layer{\textless}/em{\textgreater} defines the functional requirements of the IDS, plus the concrete features to be derived from these. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Process Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}specifies the interactions taking place between the different components of the IDS; using the BPMN notation, it provides a dynamic view of the Reference Architecture Model. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Information{\textless}/em{\textgreater} {\textless}em{\textgreater}Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}defines a conceptual model which makes use of linked-data principles for describing both the static and the dynamic aspects of the IDS’s constituents. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}System Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}is concerned with the decomposition of the logical software components, considering aspects suchas integration, configuration, deployment, and extensibility of these components. In addition, the IDS Reference Architecture Model comprises three perspectives that need to be implemented across all five layers: {\textless}em{\textgreater}Security, Certification, and Governance.{\textless}/em{\textgreater}},

New business opportunities through data-driven innovation emerge from data sharing in ecosystems. In ecosystems, the interest of the individual must be brought into alignment with the interest of the ecosystem. Trust between participants, data interoperability, and data sovereignty are key requirements which can be met by data spaces. Data spaces are a distributed data integration concept which is taken up by consortia aiming at supporting ecosystem. GAIA-X and IDS specify reference architectures for distributed data infrastructures and data spaces, respectively. While the benefits of data spaces for a fair data economy are recognized by business and policy makers, a deeper understanding is required about the design and evolution of data spaces. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts, identifies design tasks and options, and, thus, provides guidance for the establishment of data spaces.},

They address the many challenges in the overarching use of data in terms of interoperability, transparency, trust, security, and adaptation by a critical mass. For this purpose, the IDS develops a standardized architecture, which is described and continuously updated in the IDSA Reference Architecture Model (RAM) document. The core of the underlying concept is the linkage of data and usage conditions and their organizational and technical processing and enforcement. Organizational roles and responsibilities are considered on the one hand, and various technical components are defined on the other. The core of the architecture thereby, in contrast to existing solutions and approaches of completely centralized or decentralized architectures, is the paradigm of a federated structure. This enables the actual (raw) data to be exchanged exclusively between the participants without the need for a third party or a central data store. The chapter gives an overview of this approach and provides insights in terms of objectives, roles, and components that are used to enable sovereign data exchange. It enables a basic understanding of the core concept and assessing the impact of such an architecture approach.},

	abstract = {In the age of Industry 4.0, data exchange between different organizations is an essential prerequisite to add more value to data and to develop modern business models. However, we have to solve several challenges to facilitate a secure and trustworthy data exchange between different organizations. Data sovereignty is a key success factor for data-driven business models. In the International Data Spaces (IDS), we provide solutions to realize a secure and trustworthy data exchange as well as data sovereignty. In this report, we focus on data usage control and data provenance that are conceptual and technological solutions to cope with data sovereignty challenges. We introduce a common scenario for the Industry 4.0 age, in which a supplier and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) are exchanging data to mitigate risks in the supply chain management. We describe the difference between access control and usage control, the usage control concepts and related concepts such as digital rights management or user managed access. We present the implementation of data usage control in the IDS. In doing so, we present possible integration layers and its integration with the IDS Reference Architecture Model. In addition, we also present the IDS Usage Control Object as a way to transfer usage control metadata between connectors. We explain the topic of policy specification in the IDS by presenting the information model and policy language, the IDS policy classes and the IDS policy editor, which supports data owners to expressing usage restrictions. Furthermore, we show how we handle policy transformation to machine-readable policies as well as policy handshake and negotiation in the IDS. As there are different ways to implement data usage control, we present three approaches researched and developed within Fraunhofer: The MYDATA Control Technologies, the Logicbased Usage Control and Degree. Every technology is presented in detail including its integration concepts. Finally, we compare these technologies and discuss them. We address data provenance as additional concept to data usage control to cope with transparency and accountability. We conclude the document by elaborating on the current state and presenting future work, like the role of usage control in the App Store and automated IDS contract negotiation.},

In recent years, however, the rapidly-expanding demands of “data everywhere” have led to a ﬁeld comprised of interesting and productive efforts, but without a central focus or coordinated agenda. The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizations (e.g., enterprises, government agencies, libraries, “smart” homes) relying on a large number of diverse, interrelated data sources, but having no way to manage their dataspaces in a convenient, integrated, or principled fashion. This paper proposes dataspaces and their support systems as a new agenda for data management.

	abstract = {The Internet threat landscape is fundamentally changing. A major shift away from hobby hacking toward well-organized cyber crime can be observed. These attacks are typically carried out for commercial reasons in a sophisticated and targeted manner, and speciﬁcally in a way to circumvent common security measures. Additionally, networks have grown to a scale and complexity, and have reached a degree of interconnectedness, that their protection can often only be guaranteed and ﬁnanced as shared efforts. Consequently, new paradigms are required for detecting contemporary attacks and mitigating their effects. Today, many attack detection tasks are performed within individual organizations, and there is little crossorganizational information sharing. However, information sharing is a crucial step to acquiring a thorough understanding of large-scale cyber-attack situations, and is therefore seen as one of the key concepts to protect future networks. Discovering covert cyber attacks and new malware, issuing early warnings, advice about how to secure networks, and selectively distribute threat intelligence data are just some of the many use cases. In this survey article we provide a structured overview about the dimensions of cyber security information sharing. First, we motivate the need in more detail and work out the requirements for an information sharing system. Second, we highlight legal aspects and efforts from standardization bodies such as {ISO} and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}). Third, we survey implementations in terms of both organizational and technological matters. In this regard, we study the structures of Computer Emergency Response Teams ({CERTs}) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams ({CSIRTs}), and evaluate what we could learn from them in terms of applied processes, available protocols and implemented tools. We conclude with a critical review of the state of the art and highlight important considerations when building effective security information sharing platforms for the future.},

However, despite the potential benefits, successful cyber security information sharing has been difficult to achieve. We report upon a study that sought to measure the extent to which the benefits and barriers suggested by the cyber security information sharing literature are reflected in the attitudes of practising security managers and analysts. A self-administered online survey was used. The survey consisted of: several questions about the participants' experience with cyber security information sharing; and two sets of Likert-type scale items to measure the respondents' attitudes regarding the benefits and barriers identified in the literature. Our findings aim to highlight the gap between the theory and practice of information sharing and provide input for future research into design principles for information sharing systems and ways to mitigate threat information sharing challenges.},

	abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence ({CTI}) sharing has become a novel weapon in the arsenal of cyber defenders to proactively mitigate increasing cyber attacks. Automating the process of {CTI} sharing, and even the basic consumption, has raised new challenges for researchers and practitioners. This extensive literature survey explores the current state-of-the-art and approaches different problem areas of interest pertaining to the larger field of sharing cyber threat intelligence. The motivation for this research stems from the recent emergence of sharing cyber threat intelligence and the involved challenges of automating its processes. This work comprises a considerable amount of articles from academic and gray literature, and focuses on technical and non-technical challenges. Moreover, the findings reveal which topics were widely discussed, and hence considered relevant by the authors and cyber threat intelligence sharing communities.},

Since the {IODEF} model includes a wealth of available options that can be used to describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging for security practitioners to develop tools that leverage {IODEF} for incident sharing. This document provides guidelines for {IODEF} implementers. It addresses how common security indicators can be represented in {IODEF} and use-cases of how {IODEF} is being used. This document aims to make {IODEF}'s adoption by vendors easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by {CSIRTs} around the world.},

	abstract = {A recent survey of cybersecurity assessment methods proposed by the scientiﬁc community revealed that their practical adoption constitutes a great challenge. Further research that aimed at identifying the reasons for that situation demonstrated that several factors inﬂuence the applicability, including the documentation level of detail, the availability of supporting tools, and the continuity of support. This paper presents the European Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (EE-ISAC)—a cybersecurity platform for the energy sector that has been adopted by multiple organisations. The platform facilitates sharing information about cybersecurity incidents, countermeasures, and assessment results. Prospectively, it is envisaged to be integrated with the threat intelligence platform that enables real-time situational awareness. By considering both fault and attack scenarios together, threat awareness can be mapped onto operational contexts to prioritise decisions and responses. This paper analyses EE-ISAC’s approach based on the conceptual applicability framework developed during the research, to improve the applicability and usefulness of this platform for energy sector participants and to identify areas that require further development.},

	abstract = {The Internet threat landscape is fundamentally changing. A major shift away from hobby hacking toward well-organized cyber crime can be observed. These attacks are typically carried out for commercial reasons in a sophisticated and targeted manner, and speciﬁcally in a way to circumvent common security measures. Additionally, networks have grown to a scale and complexity, and have reached a degree of interconnectedness, that their protection can often only be guaranteed and ﬁnanced as shared efforts. Consequently, new paradigms are required for detecting contemporary attacks and mitigating their effects. Today, many attack detection tasks are performed within individual organizations, and there is little crossorganizational information sharing. However, information sharing is a crucial step to acquiring a thorough understanding of large-scale cyber-attack situations, and is therefore seen as one of the key concepts to protect future networks. Discovering covert cyber attacks and new malware, issuing early warnings, advice about how to secure networks, and selectively distribute threat intelligence data are just some of the many use cases. In this survey article we provide a structured overview about the dimensions of cyber security information sharing. First, we motivate the need in more detail and work out the requirements for an information sharing system. Second, we highlight legal aspects and efforts from standardization bodies such as {ISO} and the National Institute of Standards and Technology ({NIST}). Third, we survey implementations in terms of both organizational and technological matters. In this regard, we study the structures of Computer Emergency Response Teams ({CERTs}) and Computer Security Incident Response Teams ({CSIRTs}), and evaluate what we could learn from them in terms of applied processes, available protocols and implemented tools. We conclude with a critical review of the state of the art and highlight important considerations when building effective security information sharing platforms for the future.},
