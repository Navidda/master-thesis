	abstract = {A recent survey of cybersecurity assessment methods proposed by the scientiﬁc community revealed that their practical adoption constitutes a great challenge. Further research that aimed at identifying the reasons for that situation demonstrated that several factors inﬂuence the applicability, including the documentation level of detail, the availability of supporting tools, and the continuity of support. This paper presents the European Energy Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (EE-ISAC)—a cybersecurity platform for the energy sector that has been adopted by multiple organisations. The platform facilitates sharing information about cybersecurity incidents, countermeasures, and assessment results. Prospectively, it is envisaged to be integrated with the threat intelligence platform that enables real-time situational awareness. By considering both fault and attack scenarios together, threat awareness can be mapped onto operational contexts to prioritise decisions and responses. This paper analyses EE-ISAC’s approach based on the conceptual applicability framework developed during the research, to improve the applicability and usefulness of this platform for energy sector participants and to identify areas that require further development.},

The most acute information management challenges today stem from organizations (e.g., enterprises, government agencies, libraries, “smart” homes) relying on a large number of diverse, interrelated data sources, but having no way to manage their dataspaces in a convenient, integrated, or principled fashion. This paper proposes dataspaces and their support systems as a new agenda for data management.

They address the many challenges in the overarching use of data in terms of interoperability, transparency, trust, security, and adaptation by a critical mass. For this purpose, the IDS develops a standardized architecture, which is described and continuously updated in the IDSA Reference Architecture Model (RAM) document. The core of the underlying concept is the linkage of data and usage conditions and their organizational and technical processing and enforcement. Organizational roles and responsibilities are considered on the one hand, and various technical components are defined on the other. The core of the architecture thereby, in contrast to existing solutions and approaches of completely centralized or decentralized architectures, is the paradigm of a federated structure. This enables the actual (raw) data to be exchanged exclusively between the participants without the need for a third party or a central data store. The chapter gives an overview of this approach and provides insights in terms of objectives, roles, and components that are used to enable sovereign data exchange. It enables a basic understanding of the core concept and assessing the impact of such an architecture approach.},

New business opportunities through data-driven innovation emerge from data sharing in ecosystems. In ecosystems, the interest of the individual must be brought into alignment with the interest of the ecosystem.

Data spaces are a distributed data integration concept which is taken up by consortia aiming at supporting ecosystem. GAIA-X and IDS specify reference architectures for distributed data infrastructures and data spaces, respectively. While the benefits of data spaces for a fair data economy are recognized by business and policy makers, a deeper understanding is required about the design and evolution of data spaces. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts, identifies design tasks and options, and, thus, provides guidance for the establishment of data spaces.},

For an area whose strength is in open and responsive sharing, we see that the generation of feeds has a small scale, is secretive, and is nearly always from specialized businesses that have a commercial interest in not publicly sharing insights at a speed where it could be effective in raising preparedness or stopping an attack. This article has three purposes. First, we extensively review the state and challenges of open, crowd-sourced CTI, with a focus on the perceived barriers. Second, having identiﬁed that conﬁdentiality (in multiple forms) is a key barrier, we perform a conﬁdentiality threat analysis of existing sharing architectures and standards, including reviewing circa one million of real-world feeds between 2014 and 2022 from the popular open platform MISP toward quantifying the inherent risks. Our goal is to build the case that, either by redesigning sharing architectures or simply performing simple sanitization of shared information, the conﬁdentiality argument is not as strong as one may have presumed. Third, after identifying key requirements for open crowd-based sharing of CTI, we propose a reference (meta-) architecture.},

	abstract = {The International Data Spaces (IDS) are virtual data spaces leveraging existing standards and technologies, as well as governance models, well-accepted in the data economy, to facilitate secure and standardized data exchange and data linkage in a trusted business ecosystem. It thereby provides a basis for creating smart service scenarios and facilitating innovative cross-company business processes, while at the same time guaranteeing data sovereignty for data owners. Data sovereignty is a central aspect of the IDS. It can be defined as a natural person’s or corporate entity’s capability of being entirely self-determined with regard to its data. The International Data Spaces initiative proposes a Reference Architecture Model for this particular capability and related aspects, including requirements for secure and trusted data exchange in business ecosystems. Focusing on the generalization of concepts, functionality, and overall processes involved in the creation of a secure “network of trusted data”, the IDS Reference Architecture resides at a higher abstraction level than common architecture models of concrete software solutions do. The document provides an overview supplemented by dedicated architecture specifications defining the individual components of the IDS (Connector, Broker, App Store, etc.) in detail. In compliance with common system architecture models and standards (e.g., ISO 42010, 4+1 view model), the IDS Reference Architecture Model uses a five-layer structure expressing various stakeholders’ concerns and viewpoints at different levels of granularity. The general structure of the IDS Reference Architecture Model is made up of five layers: The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Business Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}specifies and categorizes the different roles which the participants of the IDS can assume, and it specifies the main activities and interactions connected with each of these roles. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Functional Layer{\textless}/em{\textgreater} defines the functional requirements of the IDS, plus the concrete features to be derived from these. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Process Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}specifies the interactions taking place between the different components of the IDS; using the BPMN notation, it provides a dynamic view of the Reference Architecture Model. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}Information{\textless}/em{\textgreater} {\textless}em{\textgreater}Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}defines a conceptual model which makes use of linked-data principles for describing both the static and the dynamic aspects of the IDS’s constituents. The {\textless}em{\textgreater}System Layer {\textless}/em{\textgreater}is concerned with the decomposition of the logical software components, considering aspects suchas integration, configuration, deployment, and extensibility of these components. In addition, the IDS Reference Architecture Model comprises three perspectives that need to be implemented across all five layers: {\textless}em{\textgreater}Security, Certification, and Governance.{\textless}/em{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In the age of Industry 4.0, data exchange between different organizations is an essential prerequisite to add more value to data and to develop modern business models. However, we have to solve several challenges to facilitate a secure and trustworthy data exchange between different organizations. Data sovereignty is a key success factor for data-driven business models. In the International Data Spaces (IDS), we provide solutions to realize a secure and trustworthy data exchange as well as data sovereignty. In this report, we focus on data usage control and data provenance that are conceptual and technological solutions to cope with data sovereignty challenges. We introduce a common scenario for the Industry 4.0 age, in which a supplier and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) are exchanging data to mitigate risks in the supply chain management. We describe the difference between access control and usage control, the usage control concepts and related concepts such as digital rights management or user managed access. We present the implementation of data usage control in the IDS. In doing so, we present possible integration layers and its integration with the IDS Reference Architecture Model. In addition, we also present the IDS Usage Control Object as a way to transfer usage control metadata between connectors. We explain the topic of policy specification in the IDS by presenting the information model and policy language, the IDS policy classes and the IDS policy editor, which supports data owners to expressing usage restrictions. Furthermore, we show how we handle policy transformation to machine-readable policies as well as policy handshake and negotiation in the IDS. As there are different ways to implement data usage control, we present three approaches researched and developed within Fraunhofer: The MYDATA Control Technologies, the Logicbased Usage Control and Degree. Every technology is presented in detail including its integration concepts. Finally, we compare these technologies and discuss them. We address data provenance as additional concept to data usage control to cope with transparency and accountability. We conclude the document by elaborating on the current state and presenting future work, like the role of usage control in the App Store and automated IDS contract negotiation.},

Although the importance of collaborative cyber-security consciousness, expressed as extensive cyber threat intelligence sharing, is undoubted, the standardization of the means of exchanging cyber threat information efficiently and securely has been inadequately addressed and is mostly expressed by the emergence of the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXIITM) protocol which faces major deficiencies when it comes to data integrity assurance and suitability for event-driven architectures. This paper presents a novel approach enabling secure and real-time exchange of cyber threat information, by extending the technological capacity of the TAXII framework and addressing its deficiencies through the integration of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and a generalized publish-subscribe middleware. The applicability of the proposed solution has been validated in several use cases addressing the real needs of Electrical Power and Energy Systems.},

	abstract = {With the application of information and communication technology (ICT), the modern power system has gradually been updated to a typical cyber physical power system (CPPS). The deployment of distributed measurement devices enriches the application range of power communication services. However, due to the easy accessibility of distributed devices, it also creates favorable conditions for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we focus on the security performance and defense strategies of the CPPS against DDoS attacks. In order to construct a coordinated defense in the power and information space, the cyber-attack process with a complete data flow of the CPPS needs to be described precisely. Therefore, a co-simulation technology-based platform is utilized to coordinate various layers in the CPPS and provide a unified research tool for the attack-defense test. On this basis, OPNET is used to replicate DDoS attacks in the information layer. Then, through the load frequency control (LFC) service of a multi-area interconnected power system, the influence of delays resulting from attacks on the control effect of the power layer is analyzed. Finally, to cope with the attack effects in both layers, detection measures of information and recovery measures of power quality are coordinated to eliminate attack consequences. Therefore, the stable operation of power services can be enabled.},

	abstract = {“All of your files have been encrypted!”, “Your device has been locked!”, and so on are the sentences that these days are often seen in the cyber world. Motivated by recent promotions of technology, ransomware attack has soared saliently in terms of volume, versatility, and intricacy. This attack has initiated a lucrative trade by holding users’ resources, whether data or non-data, hostage and demanding to pay ransom for release them. Furthermore, it has begun to camouflage other malware in many cyber-attacks. As a result, designing approaches to vanquish such threat should be taken into account. Understanding attack cycle and having an exhaustive taxonomy of ransomware, specially associated technologies, can assist to develop security measures at the various parts of attack flow. This paper has provided a comprehensive taxonomy of ransomware and digital extortion threats. A discrete and dedicated attack chain called I2CE3 has been proposed for ransomware regardless of its subcategories. The proposed chain offers six consecutive phases that ransomware species go through to triumph in attack. Afterwards, the present work has elaborated the role of all technologies involved in each phase. Finally, based on the proffered chain, performed studies and security solutions have been considered and segregated.},

	abstract = {The UK energy sector is a prime target for cyber-attacks by foreign states, criminals, ‘hacktivist’ groups, and terrorists. As Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), the industry needs to understand the threats it faces to mitigate risks and make efficient use of limited resources. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing is one means of achieving this, by leveraging sector-wide knowledge to combat ongoing mutual threats. However, being unable to segregate intelligence or to control what is disseminated to which parties, and by which means, has impeded industry cooperation thus far. The purpose of this study is to investigate the barriers to sharing and to add to the body of knowledge of CTI in the UK energy sector, while providing some level of assurance that existing tooling is fit-for-purpose. We achieve these aims by conducting a multivocal literature review and by experimentation using a simulated Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) community in a virtual environment. This work demonstrates that trust can be placed in the open-source MISP platform, with the caveat that the sharing models and tooling limitations are understood, while also taking care to create appropriate deployment taxonomies and sharing rules. It is hoped that some of the identified barriers are partially alleviated, helping to lay the foundations for a UK Energy sector CTI sharing community.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the Trusted Integrated Knowledge Dataspace (TIKD), a new dataspace, based on linked data technologies and trusted data sharing, that supports integrated knowledge graphs for sensitive application environments such as healthcare. State-of-the-art shared dataspaces do not consider sensitive data and privacy-aware log records as part of their solutions, deﬁning only how to access data. TIKD complements dataspace security approaches through trusted data sharing that considers personal data handling, data privileges, pseudonymization of user activity logging, and privacy-aware data interlinking services. TIKD was implemented on the Access Risk Knowledge (ARK) Platform, a socio-technical risk governance system, and deployed as part of the ARK-Virus Project which aims to govern the risk management of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) across a group of collaborating healthcare institutions. The ARK Platform was evaluated, both before and after implementing the TIKD, using the ISO 27001 Gap Analysis Tool (GAT) which determines compliance with the information security standard. The results of the evaluation indicated that compliance with ISO 27001 increased from 50\% to 85\%. The evaluation also provided a set of recommended actions to meet the remaining requirements of the ISO 27001 standard. TIKD provides a collaborative environment, based on knowledge graph integration and GDPR-compliant personal data handling, as part of the data security infrastructure. As a result of this work, a new trusted data security methodology, based on personal data handling, data privileges, access control context speciﬁcation, and privacyaware data interlinking, was developed using a knowledge graph approach.},

	abstract = {As smart environments move from a research vision to concrete manifestations in real-world enabled by the Internet of Things, they are encountering a number of very practical challenges in data management in terms of the flexibility needed to bring together contextual and real-time data, the interface between new digital infrastructures and existing information systems, and how to easily share data between stakeholders in the environment. Therefore, data management approaches for smart environments need to support flexibility, dynamicity, incremental change, while keeping costs to a minimum. A Dataspace is an emerging approach to data management that has proved fruitful for personal information and scientific data management. However, their use within smart environments and for real-time data remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as an enabling platform for data management within smart environments. This paper identifies common data management requirements for smart energy and water environments, details the RLD architecture and the key support services and their tiered support levels, and a principled approach to “Pay-As-You-Go” data management. The paper presents a dataspace query service for real-time data streams and entities to enable unified entity-centric queries across live and historical stream data. The RLD was validated in 5 real-world pilot smart environments following the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop to build real-time analytics, decisions support, and smart apps for energy and water management. The pilots demonstrate that the RLD enables incremental pay-as-you-go data management with support services that simplify the development of applications and analytics for smart environments. Finally, the paper discusses experiences, lessons learnt, and future directions.},

However, despite the potential benefits, successful cyber security information sharing has been difficult to achieve. We report upon a study that sought to measure the extent to which the benefits and barriers suggested by the cyber security information sharing literature are reflected in the attitudes of practising security managers and analysts. A self-administered online survey was used. The survey consisted of: several questions about the participants' experience with cyber security information sharing; and two sets of Likert-type scale items to measure the respondents' attitudes regarding the benefits and barriers identified in the literature. Our findings aim to highlight the gap between the theory and practice of information sharing and provide input for future research into design principles for information sharing systems and ways to mitigate threat information sharing challenges.},
